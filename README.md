# brainfuck
First things first, I’m not the biggest fan of esoteric languages (the community is really cool, though). It’s one of the many software-related things I’m not the biggest fan of.

That being said, Brainfuck is fun, because it is very notorious and badass, and frankly because it is a very well-crafted [joke](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Joke_language_list)

* [helloWorld.bf](https://github.com/numdar335/brainfuck/blob/main/helloWorld.bf): just a dumb "hello world" program
* [fakePiCalculator.bf](https://github.com/numdar335/brainfuck/blob/main/fakePiCalculator.bf): it’s actually kinda cool because it doesn’t perform **any** pi-related calculations whatsoever but if you claim that it does, most people won’t even **think** about proving you wrong, bahahahah
* [secretMacbeth.bf](https://github.com/numdar335/brainfuck/blob/main/secretMacbeth.bf): don’t even ask me why I made it (I’m obviously very bored), all you need to know is that it actually didn’t take long to make, even if though it kinda looks like it took forever

I also wanted to make a simple text-based RPG (Brainfuck games are the only interesting thing about this godforsaken language), but the development process would probably be **painfully** boring. Maybe one day, though!
